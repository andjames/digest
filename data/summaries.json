      "summary": "Microsoft's latest sustainability report reveals a 23.4% increase in carbon emissions since 2020, primarily due to the rapid expansion of its data centers to support cloud and AI services. This is significant as it highlights the challenges of decarbonizing the construction materials and processes that contribute to Scope 3 emissions, which account for over 97% of the company's carbon footprint. Moving forward, Microsoft must drastically reduce its emissions and enhance carbon-removal efforts to meet its 2030 sustainability goal, while simultaneously navigating the complexities of its growing operations.",
