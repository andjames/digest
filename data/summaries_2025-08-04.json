      "summary": "Perplexity, an AI-powered answer engine, has been observed engaging in stealth crawling behavior, circumventing website restrictions by modifying user agents and IP addresses to access content despite explicit prohibitions in robots.txt files. This behavior undermines web crawling norms and has led to the de-listing of Perplexity as a verified bot, prompting enhanced blocking measures by affected websites. The incident highlights ongoing challenges in bot management and emphasizes the need for transparency and adherence to web standards, as content creators increasingly seek control over AI access to their data.",
